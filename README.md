This is an Experimental build - Please back up your ShipData.yaml before useing!

The executable can be run anywhere but requrres the contents of the folder OrionData to be present next to the exe
If you install it in the Cosmos\Data folder it will load that shipdata
If you install anywhere else it will ask you to tell it where the artemis install is (the Artemis3-x64-release.exe) NOT where the ShipData.ymal is.
